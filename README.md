# CPP DSA (Data structures and algorithms)

The repository contains a very implementation of basic data structures and algorithms.

This repository also contains several bash script which can be used if the user has docker installed. The advantage to use the script that
it enables monitoring of the files inside the docker container along with memory leak checks without manually repeating the commands. Hit
save and it would simply re run the compile and execution process for you.

### NOTE: The spin-docker.sh is a POSIX compliant script and hence should be able to run on most *nix evironments provided docker is installed and is added to sudo user group
